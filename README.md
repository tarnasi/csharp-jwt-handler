# Csharp JWT Handler

a simple implantation of JWTBearer in ASP.net core API

### Features

- the program.cs has all JWT config
- one public api in ```/```
- one api for getting random names ```/home```
- one api for login (after validating user credentials, it claims an issue) ```/home/login```


It is just for fun but you can create your secret key do database things and create better validation for user authentication
in general, it is good for starting learning and working with JWT authentication in ASP.net :) have fun
